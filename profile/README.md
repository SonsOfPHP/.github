## About Sons of PHP

Sons of PHP is all about creating various PHP packages that can be used as standalone components or can be used within various frameworks. This project also contains [Contracts](https://docs.sonsofphp.com/contracts/) to help make sure [Components](https://docs.sonsofphp.com/components/) can be easily swaped out.

* All development is done in the "[Mother Repo](https://github.com/SonsOfPHP/sonsofphp)". All issues and pull requests should be done here.
* Documentation can be found at [docs.sonsofphp.com](https://docs.sonsofphp.com)
* Help and support is offered on using [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/SonsOfPHP/discussions)

## Learning Sons of PHP Components

We do our best to ensure [documentation](https://docs.sonsofphp.com) is always up to date. We also have a lot of great documentation in the source code itself. Whenever possible, we use [Contracts](https://docs.sonsofphp.com/contracts/) so that components can be easily replaced.

## Contribute

Always on the lookup for more members to help maintain and create new components. Please read the [Contributing Guide](https://docs.sonsofphp.com/contributing/) to learn more.
